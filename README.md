# clj-rust-playground

This is a Proof of Concept to interact with the Rust Playground via a simple Clojure-backed page.

The user should be able to enter code either through the RESTful interface, or via the simple
page provided to send code to the Rust Playground, and see the results of code execution.


## Usage

From the project root:

```
$ lein run
```

or if you prefer a runnable JAR instead:

```
$ lein uberjar

$ java -jar java -jar target/clj-rust-playground-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```
